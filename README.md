# Bootcamp-Week-05-Challenge

## Description

The week 05 challenge was to create a daily scheduler that was dynamically generated by the user and has features such as the current date, hour blocks that are color coded to indicate if they are past/present/future, and the ability to enter events that will persist in the local storage of the browser.
